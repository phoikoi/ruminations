## Company culture

### Onboarding

Recently I heard someone I respect very highly say "Nobody has time for onboarding."  This was in a conversation
about tech hiring and interviewing.  I couldn't disagree more strongly.  Onboarding is the linchpin
of retention.  If you screw up the first day, the first month, you're much less likely to keep the person
long term.  And employee churn is a very expensive thing.  But don't take it just from me, read the following:
